# A-bot-that-tweets-quotes

I have created a bot that scrapes quotes on certain topics from https://www.whatshouldireadnext.com/quotes/ and automatically login through a twitter account that I have created and tweets a quote every one hour. I had a lot of fun with this project in scraping, and automating tweets that requires little to no human interfere except writing the code. Yes, programmers are the creators :)
